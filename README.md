# 🛒 Online Retail Customer Cohort Analysis (Power BI)

📊 An **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze **customer retention, churn, and recovery** using cohort analysis techniques.  
The project helps businesses understand **customer lifecycle patterns** — who stays, who leaves, and who comes back.

## 🚀 Overview
Customer retention is a key growth driver for any business.  
This dashboard applies **cohort analysis** to explore how customers behave after their first purchase and how retention evolves over time.

The insights can help answer:
- How many customers return after their first month?
- What percentage of customers churn, and how quickly?
- How many are recovered vs permanently lost?
- What retention trends look like across cohorts?
